## 🤝 Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold it.

## 📝 Licensing your contribution

**Important**: by submitting a pull request, you agree to license your contribution under the
[MIT License](../LICENSE), the same terms as the rest of the project. There is no separate CLA to
sign.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) — the exact floor is pinned in
  [`global.json`](../global.json) (`10.0.302`, `rollForward: latestFeature`)
- The **.NET 8 and .NET 9 runtimes**, so the `net8.0` and `net9.0` test legs can run
- On Windows, the **.NET Framework 4.7.2 targeting pack** for the `net472` legs
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) `1.3.14` — the pinned-server test fixture builds `external/opencode` with
  it, exactly as CI does
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) with submodule support
- IDE: [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/),
  or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork with its submodules
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/opencode-sdk-dotnet.git
   cd opencode-sdk-dotnet

   # Add the upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Blind-Striker/opencode-sdk-dotnet.git
   ```

   `external/` holds read-only upstream checkouts used as protocol evidence and as the pinned-server
   test fixture. They are **never** hand-edited. If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run
   `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

3. **Run Tests**

   This project uses [TUnit](https://tunit.dev/) on Microsoft.Testing.Platform.

   ```bash
   # Run everything
   dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build

   # One project
   dotnet test tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Tests.csproj

   # A named subset
   dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Pipeline"
   ```

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Check the [Known Issues](../README.md#known-issues)** section of the README
3. **Confirm which server you hit** — this SDK is built against a pinned OpenAPI snapshot
   ([`spec/SNAPSHOT.md`](../spec/SNAPSHOT.md)), and upstream's `v2` branch moves daily, so a
   mismatch between your server build and the pin is worth ruling out first
4. **Test against the nightly package** when you can; the fix may already be on `master`

### Creating a Bug Report

Use the [bug report template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), which asks for:

- **Environment details** (SDK version, opencode server version, target framework, OS)
- **A minimal reproduction** — the smallest snippet that shows the problem
- **Expected vs actual** behavior
- **The operation and connection mode** involved, plus any error messages or stack traces

## 💡 Suggesting Features

GitHub Discussions are not enabled on this repository yet, so feature ideas go to
[Issues](https://github.com/Blind-Striker/opencode-sdk-dotnet/issues/new) as well. Describe the
use case first and the API shape second — what you are trying to do carries more weight than a
proposed signature.

Note that the **callable surface is generated** from the pinned snapshot. "Please add operation X"
is usually a curation or generator question rather than a hand-written API request; the
[protocol and generation](../docs/architecture/protocol-and-generation.md) document explains which
one you are asking for.

## 🔧 Contributing Code

### Before You Start

1. **Open an issue first** for anything beyond a small fix, so the approach can be agreed before
   the work
2. **Check for existing work** — someone may already be on it
3. **Read the canon for the area you are touching.** [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) has the routing
   table; the short version is
   [`docs/engineering/coding-style.md`](../docs/engineering/coding-style.md) for code,
   [`docs/engineering/testing-style.md`](../docs/engineering/testing-style.md) for tests, and
   [`docs/engineering/quality-gates.md`](../docs/engineering/quality-gates.md) for what "done"
   means

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and architectural decisions
   - **Never hand-edit generated output** under `src/OpenCode.Sdk` — change the generator or the
     curation config in `tools/` and regenerate
   - **Never hand-edit anything under `external/`** — those are read-only upstream checkouts
   - Add tests for new behavior
   - Update the affected documentation in the same change

3. **Run the full gate** — see below. "Builds" and "works" are different claims.

4. **Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**

   Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add the worktree refresh operation"
   git commit -m "fix: escape dot segments in bound route values"
   git commit -m "docs: document the NoThrow error model"
   ```

   **Do not add AI-attribution trailers** (`Co-Authored-By: <assistant>`, session links, or
   similar) to commit messages or PR bodies. This is repository policy, recorded in
   [`docs/engineering/workflow.md`](../docs/engineering/workflow.md).

5. **Submit the Pull Request**
   - Fill in the [PR template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Link the related issue

### The Completion Gate

Run this from the repository root before you claim a change is finished. It is the same gate CI
runs, and it is canonically owned by
[`docs/engineering/quality-gates.md`](../docs/engineering/quality-gates.md):

```bash
dotnet tool run slopwatch analyze --exclude ".scratchpad/**,external/**" --fail-on warning
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet format whitespace --verify-no-changes --no-restore
dotnet format style --verify-no-changes --no-restore --severity warn
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build
```

Changes to the protocol, generator, curation, or generated output also run:

```bash
dotnet run --file tools/opencode-tool.cs -- --help
dotnet run --file tools/opencode-tool.cs -- generate --verify
```

### Code Quality Standards

- ✅ **The analyzer wall is fail-closed and final.** Warnings are errors, `AnalysisMode` is `All`,
  and the policy is not relaxed to make a change pass. When a rule genuinely misfires, use a
  narrowly scoped arbitration comment that names the winning rule — never a global rollback.
- ✅ **XML documentation on every public API** — `GenerateDocumentationFile` is on and load-bearing.
- ✅ **`ConfigureAwait(false)` in product code**, enforced three ways (CA2007, MA0004, VSTHRD111).
  Tests are exempt.
- ✅ **The public API is locked by a reviewed baseline.** A deliberate surface change updates
  `tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Tests/Snapshots/PublicApi.verified.txt` in the same commit; an accidental one
  fails the suite.
- ✅ **Multi-target reality.** Code must build and pass on `netstandard2.0` and `net472`, not only
  on modern targets.
- ✅ **No suppressions to make a test green.** If a test is wrong, fix the test and say why.

### Testing Guidelines

- **Unit and contract tests** — deterministic, no live server; fakes only for published contracts
- **Integration tests** — real process boundaries where the process boundary *is* the product
  (the launcher, the PTY doors)
- **Live tests** — gated on a reachable server, skipped otherwise

When adding tests, put them in the project that owns the seam, follow the existing naming, cover
both the success and the refusal path, and respect the parallelism rules in
[`docs/engineering/testing-style.md`](../docs/engineering/testing-style.md) — server-process and
timing-bounded tests are deliberately serialized.

Scratch work belongs under the gitignored `.scratchpad/`; nothing permanent may reference it.

## 📚 Documentation

- **Code comments** explain the *why*, not the *what*
- **XML documentation** is required on public APIs
- **The consumer guide** under [`docs/guide/`](../docs/guide) is the user-facing home; keep it
  current with behavior changes
- **The CHANGELOG** gets an entry for every user-facing change
- **Every current fact has one canonical owner**; other mentions relay to it rather than restating
  it. [`docs/engineering/documentation.md`](../docs/engineering/documentation.md) owns this rule.

## 🔍 Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (build, format, analyzers, tests, on all three OSes)
2. **Maintainer review** — we aim to respond within 48 hours
3. **Iterative improvements** — address feedback promptly
4. **Final approval** and merge
