# Third-Party Notices

## opencode

Upstream project: [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)

Derived content in this repository:

- `spec/openapi.json` — the accepted snapshot of upstream's `packages/protocol/openapi.json`, at
  the exact commit [`spec/SNAPSHOT.md`](spec/SNAPSHOT.md) pins. It is produced from upstream's own
  generator, so it is a derived copy rather than an independent description.
- `spec/patches/` — snapshot-production patches whose context lines quote upstream TypeScript
  source. The patches themselves are this repository's work; the quoted context is upstream's.
- `external/opencode` — a submodule reference. Nothing of it is redistributed by this repository;
  a clone fetches it from upstream directly.

Generated SDK source under `src/OpenCode.Sdk/` is emitted by this repository's own generator from
the accepted snapshot. Upstream's notice follows.
