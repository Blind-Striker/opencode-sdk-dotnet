// The parity oracle for the structural union first-match arm (ADR-0016).
//
// It decodes every value of tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Tests/Fixtures/Unions/first-match-corpus.json with
// upstream's own schemas and upstream's own Effect, then writes which union member took each value
// to first-match-expected.json beside it. The SDK's parity test asserts that the generated
// converters pick the same member. Re-run it when a refresh moves the pinned Effect version (the
// source watch on the effect catalog line trips) or touches one of the three schemas:
//
//   bun tools/oracles/first-match-union.ts
//
// It only reads the submodule: the schemas and Effect are imported from external/opencode as the
// pinned checkout installs them (bun install in external/opencode).
