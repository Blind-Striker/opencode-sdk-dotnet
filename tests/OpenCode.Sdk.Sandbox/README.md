# OpenCode.Sdk.Sandbox

A committed local playground for driving the SDK against a real `opencode2 serve` under a
debugger. It rides the repository's full convention set (analyzers, `.editorconfig`, format
gate) — unlike `.scratchpad/`, which remains the home for throwaway prototypes that answer a
question and disappear.

Configuration comes from environment variables, prefilled for the IDE by
`Properties/launchSettings.json` (profiles `sandbox-session-log` and `sandbox-events`):

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_SANDBOX_ENDPOINT` | Absolute server endpoint (required) |
| `OPENCODE_PASSWORD` / `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` | Resolved by sandbox code and passed as `OpenCodeClientOptions.Password` — the SDK itself reads no environment |

## Running

Start a server with a fixed password so the checked-in profile matches (`serve` adopts the
same `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` variable; without it the server generates and prints a
random one):

```sh
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=123456 opencode2 serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4096
```

Then F5 with one of the sandbox profiles, or run either stream mode directly:

```sh
dotnet run --project tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Sandbox -- --stream
dotnet run --project tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Sandbox -- --events
```

The stream example composes through the Extensions package:
`AddOpenCode` registers one singleton client family, and the Generic Host injects its
`SessionsClient` into `SessionLogWorker`. The worker creates a session, obtains its bound
`SessionClient`, and follows `GetLogAsync` through the host's normal `stoppingToken`.
Each frame is logged with its generated runtime type. Ctrl+C stops the host, cancels the
open response read, and disposes the singleton SDK transport with the container.

The event mode injects `EventsClient` into `EventBusWorker` and consumes the volatile global bus.
After it reports that the bus is opening, trigger server activity from another process; running the
standing breadth walkthrough without a mode flag creates a session and supplies representative
events. The bus has no replay or resume contract: events during disconnection are missed, and a slow
consumer can overflow and fail the stream. Ctrl+C exercises the same host cancellation path.

`--stream` and `--events` are mutually exclusive. Run without either flag to keep driving the
standing breadth walkthrough: health, session
create/list/get, message list, export with its sanitize query, the permission
create/get/reply round trip, and the NoThrow spine over compact and a deliberately bad fork
boundary, all through the same Extensions registration.
