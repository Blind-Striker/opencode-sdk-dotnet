/// leg is its standing user - it points the same fixture at the published
/// <c>@opencode/cli</c> build with <c>opencode|serve</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The value is <c>|</c>-separated rather than space-separated so a path with spaces survives,
/// which is the convention <c>OPENCODE_SANDBOX_SERVER_COMMAND</c> already established
/// (<c>tests/OpenCode.Sdk.Sandbox/StandaloneServerWalkthrough.cs</c>). Tokens are handed to the
/// launcher exactly as written: resolving the executable from <c>PATH</c> (with <c>PATHEXT</c> on
/// Windows, which is what starts an npm <c>.cmd</c> shim) is the shipped launcher's job, not this
/// type's, so a bare <c>opencode</c> is a correct value and is never probed here.
