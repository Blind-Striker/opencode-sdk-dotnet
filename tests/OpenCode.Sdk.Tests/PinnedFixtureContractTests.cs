/// <summary>
/// The contract between this repository's JavaScript fixtures and the accepted snapshot. A fixture
/// that boots the pinned server imports upstream modules by name, and upstream is free to rename a
/// package under a refresh: it renamed its whole workspace scope once already. Nothing else catches
/// that, because the refresh receipt watches the sources the hand-written doors read rather than the
/// module identifiers a fixture writes, so the mismatch would otherwise reach the suite as a server
/// that exits before readiness.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This reads the snapshot on disk rather than an installed tree on purpose. A developer machine
/// that installed before a rename keeps the previous revision's workspace links alongside the new
/// ones, so the old names still resolve there and a local run agrees while hosted CI does not.
