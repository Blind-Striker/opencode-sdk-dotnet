# Repository Workflow

Date: 2026-08-18

Canonical working agreements for research, implementation, temporary work, verification, and Git
history.

## Collaboration

- Be direct, practical, and clear. Challenge decisions with mechanisms and sources rather than
  convention; do not agree your way into a weaker architecture.
- A question asks for an answer, not an unrequested mutation. When a request is ambiguous, present
  the options, recommend one, and ask.
- Align on structure and direction before writing. Prefer the smallest correct change over a broad
  refactor.
- When implementation contradicts current canon, stop the affected work and follow
  `../agents/deviation-protocol.md`; never silently code around the contradiction.

## Repository artifacts and temporary work

All repository-authored artifacts are written in English.

Everything temporary - prototypes, scratch scripts, generated probes, and working notes - lives
under the fully gitignored root `.scratchpad/` directory. Nothing permanent references it. Keep its
minimal `Directory.Build.props` stub as an empty project that disables central package management, so
scratch projects do not inherit the repository's strict build infrastructure. Validated outcomes
move into code or canonical documentation.

Upstream submodules under `external/` are read-only evidence. Never hand-edit them.

## Verification and generated output

Verification requirements live in `quality-gates.md`. Run them before claiming completion and state
honestly what was not run. Generated SDK output changes through the generator and is reviewed as a
complete diff; it is never hand-edited.

## Documentation sessions

Research and decision sessions end with a documentation pass: a chronological research log in
question -> finding -> decision form, topic evidence where it adds retrieval value, current canon or
ADR updates when a decision changes, and operational state in the roadmap. The resulting change is
one coherent commit after maintainer approval.

Documentation maintenance follows `documentation.md`, especially its lossless-relocation and
single-owner rules.

## Commits and CI

- Commit only with maintainer approval, except inside an explicitly agreed development loop where
  committing is part of the flow.
- Use Conventional Commits: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, or
  `chore`. Do not add AI-attribution trailers.
- `perf` is distinct from `refactor` because performance work requires before/after benchmark
  evidence.
- A documentation-only follow-up to an already-green mixed pull request may use `[skip ci]` only
  when every change since the tested commit is Markdown or `LICENSE`. Never skip CI for source,
  tests, project/build files, tool manifests or baselines, workflows, or generated artifacts.
